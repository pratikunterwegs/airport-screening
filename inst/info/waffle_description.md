Given the scenario set out in the panel, consider 100 infected air travellers who, if there was no screening, would arrive at their destination infected. This simulation calculates how many of those 100 travellers are likely to:

* be detected via <b><span style="color:#66C2A5"> exit screening on departure</span></b>
* present with <b><span style="color:#E78AC3">severe disease during travel</span></b>
* be detected via <b><span style="color:#8DA0CB">entry screening on arrival</span></b>, or
* <b><span style="color:#FC8D62">not be detected</span></b>.
<br/><br/>

The aim of entry screening is to detect infected people who were not detected at exit screening. Therefore we also provide the percentage of these infections who were subsequently detected as severe on the flight, or were detected at entry screening.
