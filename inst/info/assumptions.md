## Key assumptions

* Asymptomatically infected travellers are infectious
* Would-be travellers will not travel if hospitalised
* Screening at exit and entry are independent processes
* Probability of detection by screening does not depend on intensity of symptoms
* Estimated proportions are averages. Substantial variation in proportions are expected if only a small number of travellers are considered
* Travellers will self-report only when they become severely symptomatic during their travel
* Travellers may become severely symptomatic either from a latent state (having boarded the plane with a latent infection) or from a symptomatic state (having gone undetected by the exit screening)
* Travellers developing severe symptoms during their travel will be hospitalised without entry screening
* Asypmtomatically infected travellers remain asymptomatic throughout their entire infection
* All symptomatic travellers will eventually be reported
